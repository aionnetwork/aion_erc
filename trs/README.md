# TRS Contract Suite

TRS (Token Release Schedule) is an opt-in system in which Aion tokens are locked into a non-negotiable release schedule over a certain period of time. This is both used for the public (to effectively commit to their funds to the network for a number of months) and the foundation (to commit their funds over a number of months, ensuring continued commitment to the project).

## Features

Since the previous release, the TRS contract has implemented the following functionality:

1) Ability for users to deposit tokens into the contract (removed).
2) Ability for foundation to deposit tokens for users into the contract.
3) Ability to "update" the total balance after locking.
4) Ability to remove special payout, t0special = 0. This will be used by foundation.
